Merry Christmas (Dec 24, 2011, written in Perl)
===============================================

Displays a "Merry Christmas" greeting.

Actually, what it does is it extracts a particular fragment from a code sample
in the "perlsyn" Perl documentation section, which happens to say "Merry
Christmas". Of course, this isn't going to work if the documentation changes in
the future.

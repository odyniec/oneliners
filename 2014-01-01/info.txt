Happy New Year (Jan 1, 2014, written in C/Bash/Perl)
====================================================

Prints out "Happy New Year!".

It's a rather simple polyglot, a program that can be compiled or interpreted by
multiple languages and produce the same effect.

(And it's not really an oneliner.)

For a more interesting example of a polyglot program, see
